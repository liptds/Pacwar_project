# This is the comp440 PacWar Simulator.  You can run it directly via
#
#                  myWish -f PacWar.tcl
#
# to get things started.

# NOTE: The Makefile in this folder has been written for MacOS
# You will have to point to the location of X11 and tcl/tk libraries on your
# platform to use the Makefile on a non-Mac machine.
# Make sure you have the latest version of XCode with xcode-select --install

# You can remake everything by 
# >> rm *.o
# >> make all

# If you want to modify this code in any way, copy the contents of the 
# directory named C to your own directory. You can link to the
# bitmaps directory to save space by typing
#       ln -s C/bitmaps 
# from your directory.
#
# Note that the object file PacWarGuts.o can be used to test a species
# and/or run a duel without using the graphics.  This makes it ideal
# for integrating into a program that searches the space of possible
# genes.

# The rules of the game can be found under the projects section of the
# course homepage on Canvas. Read the PacWarGuts.c file to understand how
# the genetic code of 50 "bits" works.

# To win this competition, you should start exploring the species
# as soon as possible.
#
# For ideas on how to construct a species designer, read the chapters on
# search algorithms, particularly local search algorithms, in the course textbook.

# Explanation of menu options in the Pacwar simulator
#
# The  Exec menu allows you to Run, Step (advance the                                          
# currently running simulation by one time step), Stop, Reset (which
# kills whatever simulation was running or stopped), and Quit.
#
# The Genes menu allows you to Modify a List of genes                                         
# (composed initially of species that is all 1s, all 2s, and all 3s, 
# called ones, twos and threes respectively), Read Genes from                                   
# a file (look at the file class.data for an example of the expected format) 
# and Write Genes (that writes out all species in                                      
# current list maintained by the simulator into a file in the required format
#
# The Display menu controls the display of the simulation.                                    
# You have three choices: small, medium and large which sets the size
# of the simulation display.
#
# The  Test and  Duel buttons allow you to switch  between the two modes of the
# simulation:
# Test Mode allows you to study the behavior of a single species in isolation,
# e.g., its growth patterns and gross behaviour changes upon perturbing sets of
# genes.
# Duel Mode allows you to run a duel between two species (which may actually
# both be  the same species); you can specify the candidate species by
# selecting from  the pop-up menu that appears when you click on one or the
# other's name.
#
# The Step button advances the current simulation by one round.
