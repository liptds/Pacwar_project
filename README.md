# Pacwar project

## This problem is about designing killer species that live in an imaginary world called PAC-world, created by Donald Knuth of Stanford University.

1. Development_set is the tool_kit for running the pacwar tournament. You will get the result of a torunament between genes.

2. Project_report.pdf is the summary for this project.

3. Code folder consists of our final code for this project with initial try on GSAT algorithm to Genetic Algorithm and also GA + Variational autoencoder to create better gene pools. Some polishing techniques are also applied to create stronger and more robust genes.
